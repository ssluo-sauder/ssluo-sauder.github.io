Hello, welcome to my website! ðŸ˜€ 

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Management Science at Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Prof. Steven Shechter](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/steven-shechter){:target="_blank"}. I received my M.A. in Applied Mathematics from University of Pennsylvania and my B.S. in Statistics from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University.

I am interested in applying optimization and data-driven methods to solve problems in healthcare operations. My current research focuses on preventive healthcare, including optimizing vaccination schedules to reduce infection risk and designing peer-based competitions in fitness platforms to promote healthy behavior.
